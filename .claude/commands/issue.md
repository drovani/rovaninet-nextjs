# Issue Command

Analyze and resolve a GitHub issue by implementing the necessary code changes, tests, and creating a pull request.

## Usage
```
issue [ISSUE_NUMBER]
```

## Arguments
- `ISSUE_NUMBER` (required): The GitHub issue number to analyze and resolve

## What this command does:
1. Retrieves issue details using `gh issue view` to understand the problem
2. Analyzes the issue description, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. Searches the codebase for relevant files and existing implementations
4. Creates a new branch for this feature, bug, or other enhancement.
5. Implements the necessary code changes to resolve the issue
6. Writes and runs unit tests (`npm run test`) to verify the fix works correctly
7. Ensures all code passes TypeScript type checking (`npm run tsc`)
8. Creates a descriptive commit message following project conventions
9. Pushes changes and creates a pull request linked to the original issue

## Examples
```bash
# Analyze and fix issue 15
issue 15

# Resolve bug report in issue 42
issue 42

# Implement feature request from issue 123
issue 123
```

## Requirements
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be authenticated
- User must have write permissions to the repository
- Issue must contain sufficient detail to understand the problem/requirement
- Development environment must be properly set up with dependencies

## Output
The command will:
- Display issue details and analysis of the problem
- Show which files are being modified during implementation
- Report test results and type checking status
- Confirm successful commit and PR creation
- Provide the PR URL for review

## Implementation Steps
1. **Issue Analysis**: Fetch and parse issue details to understand requirements
2. **Codebase Search**: Identify relevant files and existing patterns
3. **Code Implementation**: Make necessary changes following project conventions
4. **Testing**: Write and execute tests to validate the solution
5. **Quality Checks**: Run linting and type checking to ensure code quality
6. **Documentation**: Update documentation if the change affects user-facing features
7. **Commit & PR**: Create meaningful commit message and pull request

## Safety Notes
- Always creates a new branch for changes (never commits directly to main)
- Runs comprehensive tests before creating the PR
- Links the PR to the original issue for proper tracking
- Follows the project's coding standards and conventions
